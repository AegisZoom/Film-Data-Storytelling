# A Data Visualisation Presentation: Are movies decreasing in quality? 

## MATH2270: Data Visualisation and Communication

### Grade: 92.5%

## Introduction

This repository contains my work for the third and final assignment of MATH2270 in my Graduate Diploma of Data Science. The assessment was worth 40% of the final grade, 
and required that I develop a 10-slide presentation that used data and visualisations to tell a story. There was emphasis placed on seeking fresh and create topics to
explore (otherwise grades would be lowered), and so I decided to rigourously assess the popular opinion that ***"movies used to be so much better!"*** using aggregate statistics
of film ratings on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes.

## Skills Used

- 💾 Programming: Used R 📉 as the programming language for the RMarkdown file, with RStudio as the IDE, and the Readr, Stringr, Dplyr, Tidyr, Lubridate, GGplot2, Plotly, and Magrittr libraries for development.
- 📈 Data Analysis: Performed background statistical measurements to gauge aggregate film trends with time dependence. Performed significant multivariate analysis to identify trends in the data relating to the topic.
- 📊 Data Visualisation: Constructed interactive scatter plots that allowed users to customise filters and reveal information on data points of interest on charts. Designed the visualisations to constructively develop understanding of the topic and its misconceptions by highlighting subtle trends in film ratings.
- 🧼 Data Cleaning: Corrected datatypes of many variables between datasets, identified outliers using univariate and multivariate techniques, dealt with missing values, applied data transformations, processed unit conversions, and merged/separated variables and data frames. Addressed errors and compatibility issues resulting from these merges.
- 📧 Data Retrieval: Browsed online (especially Kaggle) for high-quality datasets of IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes reviews that covered a large and diverse array of films. Converted data files to appropriate formats for cleaning and exploration.
- 📐 Problem-Solving: Applied a wide variety of techniques to each stage of the project to account for as many possibilities as possible. Selected appropriate techniques using a mixture of strong theoretical knowledge and a natural intuition based on real life limitations.
- 🔍 Debugging/Attention to Detail: Developed techniques and intuition for identifying glitches that produced abnormal results or errors in various stages of the project. Identified opportunities to gather further insight into the data and model optimisation. Identified the presence and implications of trends, relationships, and outliers in the data.
- 📝 Written Communication: Submitted a 12-page report of the development of the project at all stages, including background research, data cleaning procedures, exploration of trends and relationships in the data, and the procedures to train, evaluate and optimise machine learning models.
- ⏰ Time Management: Organised weekly schedules and deadlines for individual milestones with leeway for unexpected obstacles both related to and outside of the assessment, and prioritised developing the report alongside the programming portion of the assessment.
- 🔬 Research: Extensively investigated techniques and solutions online to add advanced features to data visualisations. Performed background research in glass production to better understand the chemical properties of glass before beginning the project.
